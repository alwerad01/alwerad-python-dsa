# alwerad-python-dsa
structured, well-documented collection of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms implemented in Python — including patterns, explanations, complexity analysis, and my learning journey.

## 📘 **alwerad-python-dsa**

A structured and well-documented collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms in Python**, built as my personal learning journey toward strong problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

---

### 🧠 **Goals of This Repository**

* Master core **Data Structures**
* Understand **Algorithms** deeply, not by memorization
* Build a strong problem-solving mindset
* Implement clean, optimized Python solutions
* Track progress consistently
* Prepare for technical interviews & ML foundations

---

### 📂 **Repository Structure**

```
/notes/                   → Explanations, patterns, concepts
/arrays/                  → Coding problems + solutions
/strings/
/linked_list/
/hashing/
/recursion/
/dynamic_programming/
/tests/                   → Unit tests for code quality
learning-roadmap.md       → My weekly plan and progress
```

### 🧩 **What Each Solution Includes**

Every problem file contains:

* Problem summary
* My thought process
* Approach explanation
* Time & space complexity
* Final Python solution
* Optional optimized version

This proves real understanding — not copy-paste.

---

### 🗓️ **Commit Philosophy**

I aim for **consistency**, not forced daily streaks.

* 3–5 meaningful commits per week
* Clean, readable code
* Proper documentation
* Clear commit messages

---

### 🚀 **Long-Term Vision**

This repo will evolve into a complete reference for:

* Patterns (two pointers, sliding window, BFS/DFS, DP)
* Interview prep
* Foundations for Machine Learning

---

### 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning repository, but feedback is welcome.

Just tell me — **do you want templates too?**
